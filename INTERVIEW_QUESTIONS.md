## Answers
1. **What is GitHub Pages, and how does it work?**  
   GitHub Pages is a free service to host static websites directly from a GitHub repository. It works by serving HTML, CSS, and JavaScript files from a specified branch (e.g., `main`) and folder (e.g., root). You enable it in the repositoryâ€™s Settings > Pages, and GitHub provides a URL like `username.github.io/repo-name`.

2. **Can you host dynamic applications on GitHub Pages?**  
   No, GitHub Pages is limited to static content (HTML, CSS, JavaScript). Dynamic apps requiring server-side processing (e.g., PHP, Node.js) or databases need platforms like Heroku or AWS.

3. **What are the limitations of GitHub Pages?**  
   - 1 GB storage per repo.
   - 100 GB bandwidth per month.
   - 10 builds per hour limit.
   - No server-side code or databases.
   - Individual files max 100 MB.

4. **How do you update a website hosted on GitHub Pages?**  
   Edit files locally (e.g., `index.html`), commit changes with `git commit -m "Update content"`, and push with `git push origin main`. The site updates automatically within a minute.

5. **What happens if you delete the repository hosting a GitHub Pages site?**  
   The site becomes inaccessible, returning a 404 error. The URL stops working, and any custom domain link breaks unless reassigned.

6. **How do you add custom CSS to a GitHub Pages site?**  
   Create a CSS file (e.g., `styles.css`), link it in `index.html` with `<link rel="stylesheet" href="styles.css">`, and push both files to the repo. Ensure the file path matches.

7. **What is the default file that loads on a GitHub Pages site?**  
   The default file is `index.html`. GitHub serves it automatically from the root or specified folder if present.
